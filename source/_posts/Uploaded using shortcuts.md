# This is an article posted using Shortcuts

I created a shortcut to upload articles to GitHub. And then with the help of CI, the static blog can be generated automatically.

You can find the shortcut [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ca6a3c6fc12e4c9e82a8979618360775).

Thanks to the [tutorial](https://blessing.studio/deploy-hexo-blog-automatically-with-travis-ci/index.html) on how to setup Travis CI for HEXO.
